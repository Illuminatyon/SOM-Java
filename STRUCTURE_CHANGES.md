# Project Structure Changes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to the project structure to improve organization and consistency.

## Changes Made

1. **Consolidated Directory Structure**
   - Moved all Java source files to a single, consistent location: `src/main/java/com/fabio/som/`
   - Archived the redundant `Self Organizing Map` directory to avoid confusion

2. **Fixed Package Declarations**
   - Updated package declarations in all Java files to use the correct package: `com.fabio.som`
   - Previously, some files were using incorrect package: `main.java.com.fabio.som`

3. **Created Missing Files**
   - Created `SOMProcessor.java` in the correct location with proper package declaration
   - This file was missing but referenced by `SOMApplication.java`

4. **Verified Functionality**
   - Tested the reorganized code structure by building and running the application
   - Confirmed that the application works correctly with the new structure

## File Locations

### Before

```
Project Root
├── src/main/java/com/fabio/som/
│   └── SOMApplication.java
└── Self Organizing Map/
    ├── Self Organizing Map.iml
    └── src/main/java/com/fabio/som/
        ├── DataPoint.java (incorrect package)
        └── Neuron.java (incorrect package)
```

### After

```
Project Root
├── src/main/java/com/fabio/som/
│   ├── SOMApplication.java
│   ├── DataPoint.java (correct package)
│   ├── Neuron.java (correct package)
│   └── SOMProcessor.java (new file)
└── Self Organizing Map.bak/ (archived)
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Organization**
   - All source files are now in a single, standard location
   - No more confusion about which version of a file to use

2. **Correct Package Structure**
   - All files now use the correct package declaration
   - This ensures proper class loading and avoids runtime errors

3. **Complete Implementation**
   - All required files are now present in the correct location
   - The application can build and run successfully

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Implementation of SOMProcessor**
   - The current implementation has placeholder methods for some functionality
   - These should be fully implemented for complete functionality

2. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Create unit tests to verify the functionality of each class
   - This will help ensure that future changes don't break existing functionality

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update any documentation that references the old file structure
   - Ensure that all classes and methods are properly documented
