# Implementation Summary

## Overview of Changes

This project has completely reimplemented the original Self-Organizing Map (SOM) code with significant improvements in code quality, documentation, and usability. The following major changes were made:

### 1. Improved Code Structure

- Renamed classes to better reflect their purpose:
  - `Weight` → `DataPoint`
  - `Neuron` → `Neuron` (name kept but improved)
  - `Traitement` → `SOMProcessor`
  - `Lancement` → `SOMApplication`

- Organized code into a proper package structure: `com.fabio.som`

### 2. Enhanced Code Quality

- Improved variable naming for better readability
- Added proper error handling with specific exceptions
- Used Java collections framework appropriately
- Implemented defensive programming with input validation
- Added additional utility methods for common operations
- Improved resource management with try-with-resources
- Simplified complex algorithms for better readability
- Used consistent coding style and formatting

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

- Added detailed Javadoc for all classes and methods
- Created a comprehensive README.md with usage instructions
- Developed a TESTING_GUIDE.md for verification procedures
- Updated author name to "Fabio GUERREIRO MARQUES" throughout

### 4. Better User Experience

- Enhanced command-line interface with clear prompts
- Added support for command-line arguments
- Improved error messages and user feedback
- Created a build script for easy compilation and execution
- Added a test data file for verification

### 5. Additional Features

- Added input validation for all user inputs
- Implemented better randomization with a dedicated Random instance
- Added methods for calculating distances between data points
- Improved the SOM training algorithm with clearer phases
- Enhanced visualization of results

## Files Created

1. `src/main/java/com/fabio/som/DataPoint.java`
2. `src/main/java/com/fabio/som/Neuron.java`
3. `src/main/java/com/fabio/som/SOMProcessor.java`
4. `src/main/java/com/fabio/som/SOMApplication.java`
5. `README.md`
6. `TESTING_GUIDE.md`
7. `build.bat`
8. `data/test_data.csv`

## Conclusion

The reimplemented code is now more maintainable, better documented, and provides a more user-friendly experience. The Self-Organizing Map algorithm remains functionally equivalent to the original implementation but with significant improvements in code quality and usability.

The code now follows modern Java programming practices and provides a solid foundation for further enhancements or extensions.
